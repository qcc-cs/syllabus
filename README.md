### Undergraduate Research

This is a research intensive course and students will do their research in small teams. The topic for the research project will be **"Solving the numerical problems in science with programming"**. Each group will find numerical problems in their science courses including mathematics and develop the C++ software to solve their problems. Each research group will submit the 4-6page design report and the code. They will also deliver 10-15 min presentation in the class room.

Therefore **CUNY RCR training is necessary for all students**. I will post a detail schedule at piazza.com later.

### Project Policy
**There is no late projects will be accepted.** I strongly suggested you submit at least one day earlier than their due dates. Academic Integrity is very important. **All projects must be the original work of the student (and group if applicable) to get a proper grade for projects.**
- For regular projects, students will submit their **project code and design report** to sagemathcloud.com.
- For the final team project, students will submit their **project code, design report and presentation** to [github.com](https://github.com/)

### No SNS and phone policy
Please, silence your cellphone and other electronic devices. Except early notice, do not use SNS or phone.
**For the quiz and test, students should turn off their electronic devices and put them in their bag to avoid a failing grade for the quiz, or test.**

### Attendance Policy
**Unexcused absences beyond 15% of course hours(2 weeks) result in a failing grade for the course.**  To excuse your absences, **a proper document with early notice** is necessary. Two late marks count as one absence. If students leave early with early notice, I will consider as one late mark.
