Overland, 2nd Edition, Prentice Hall Publishing\r\n### Grading\r\n- Class exam(30%):TEST 1, TEST2, TEST3\r\n- LAB(45%)\r\n -- LAB CODING QUIZ(10%): 4 quizzes + 1 extra credit quiz(2%)\r\n -- Regular Project(25%): 5 projects\r\n -- Final team research project(10%) - code and  the presentation.\r\n- Final(25%)- **I will replace one of lowest scores of TEST1, 2, 3 if final score is higher.**\r\n- **No MAKE UP QUIZ / TEST.** Please, contact me before QUIZ or TEST if you have any problem.\r\n\r\n### April 16, 2015 is the last day to withdraw.\r\n\r\n### Communication\r\nWe will use 3 separate websites for this course. You need to sign-up using your **tigermail**.\r\n- **Piazza.com** - Q&A discussion board with course materials including project,quiz and test. Download the app from app store or playstore.\r\n- **sagemathcloud.com** - Tools for development and collaboration.\r\n- **bitbucket.org** - Source management system for projects.\r\n \r\n### Undergraduate Research\r\n\r\nThis is a research intensive course and students will do their research in small teams. The topic for the research project will be **\"Solving the numerical problems in science with programming\"**. Each group will find numerical problems in their science courses including mathematics and develop the C++ software to solve their problems. Each research group will submit the 4-6page design report and the code. They will also deliver 10-15 min presentation in the class room.\r\n\r\nTherefore **CUNY RCR training is necessary for all students**. I will post a detail schedule at piazza.com later.\r\n\r\n### Project Policy\r\n**There is no late projects will be accepted.** I strongly suggested you submit at least one day earlier than their due dates. Academic Integrity is very important. **All projects must be the original work of the student (and group if applicable) to get a proper grade for projects.**\r\n- For regular projects, students will submit their **project code and design report** to sagemathcloud.com.\r\n- For the final team project, students will submit their **project code, design report and presentation** to bitbucket.org\r\n\r\n### No SNS and phone policy\r\nPlease, silence your cellphone and other electronic devices. Except early notice, do not use SNS or phone.\r\n**For the quiz and test, students should turn off their electronic devices and put them in their bag to avoid a failing grade for the quiz, or test.**\r\n\r\n### Attendance Policy\r\n**Unexcused absences beyond 15% of course hours(2 weeks) result in a failing grade for the course.**  To excuse your absences, **a proper document with early notice** is necessary. Two late marks count as one absence. If students leave early with early notice, I will consider as one late mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
